# Feature Completeness Matrix

Tracks how complete each shipped content entity and system is against
[`content-dod.md`](content-dod.md). **Maintenance rule (AGENTS.md §11): any PR that
adds or changes game content must update the affected rows in the same PR.**
The game-designer agent reads this file at the start of every cycle and
prioritizes closing gaps over proposing new content.

Legend: ✅ done · 🔨 open issue filed (referenced) · ❌ gap, no issue yet · — not applicable

Machine-checkable [V] aspects disappear from this file once the corresponding
`--validate-data` rule exists (the validator then owns them); this matrix tracks
what validation cannot.

| shaman | ✅ (#516) | ✅ #522 | ✅ #523 | ✅ #524 | ✅ #521 | ✅ #547 | ✅ #556 |
| warrior | ✅ (#516) | ✅ #522 | ✅ #523 | ✅ #524 | ✅ #521 | ✅ #547 | ✅ #556 |

Balance-pass niche rationale (baseline for future passes, #556). Every class's
`level_gains` share a fixed 18-point budget (hp+mana+move), so no class is strictly
stronger — only the distribution, carry, healing, attribute bonuses and kit size differ
by archetype. For no archetype is one class's full package (stats + total kit size) a
superset of a peer's:

- **melee-str — warrior vs. paladin.** Warrior is the pure bruiser: top HP (13/lvl), top
  carry (20), best self-heal (+3), but the lightest attribute bonus (`str +2`) and only 4
  abilities. Paladin trades raw HP/carry for `armor +5`, extra mana, a third attribute
  point (`str +2, wis +1`) and a fifth ability (divine shield / lay on hands) — hybrid
  durability, not a warrior upgrade.
- **caster-int — mage vs. necromancer.** Previously an identical stat block with an
  unequal kit; now split. Mage is the fragile nuker: lowest HP (6/lvl), highest mana
  (9/lvl), the deepest toolkit (4 starting + 3 trainable = 7 abilities). Necromancer trades
  spell mana (7/lvl) and two abilities (5 total) for sturdier health (8/lvl), extra carry
  (6) and matching self-sustain via life drain (`healing -1`) — the durable attrition
  caster who stands behind its pets. Neither package is a superset of the other.
- **caster-wis-hybrid — cleric vs. druid vs. shaman.** Cleric is the dedicated healer:
  best healing (+2), most carry (10) and the biggest kit (4 starting, incl. resurrection),
  paid for with the slowest move of any class (2/lvl). Druid keeps normal move (3) and a
  higher mana pool for nature damage; shaman keeps normal move (3) and the extra HP of a
  totem hybrid (8/lvl) with three starting abilities. Each wins at least one axis (move or
  mana or HP) that cleric does not.
- **agi-skirmish — rogue vs. ranger.** Rogue is the burst/utility skirmisher: highest HP
  in the pair (10/lvl), most carry (8), and the largest kit (4 starting: backstab, envenom,
  pick, sneak). Ranger is the mobility/reach specialist: the fastest class afoot (unique
  move 5/lvl) with more mana (5/lvl), trading HP and kit size for unmatched mobility and
  ranged tracking. Rogue does not dominate ranger's move/mana; ranger does not dominate
  rogue's HP/carry/kit.
- **generalist / support outliers.** Adventurer is the deliberately forgiving beginner
  (lightest `str +1, int +1` bonus, balanced 10/5/3 vitals, bash + self-heal). Bard is the
  fragile group-support caster (spread `agi +1, int +1, wis +1`, buff/debuff songs); neither
  shares an archetype pair, so neither can be a superset of a peer.

## Races

| Race | Stat profile | Creation description | Attribute bonuses | Balance pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| dwarf | ✅ | ✅ #521 | ✅ #524 | ✅ #554 |
| elf | ✅ | ✅ #521 | ✅ #524 | ✅ #554 |
| human | ✅ | ✅ #521 | ✅ #524 | ✅ #554 |
| orc | ✅ | ✅ #521 | ✅ #524 | ✅ #554 |
| troll | ✅ | ✅ #521 | ✅ #524 | ✅ #554 |

Balance-pass niche rationale (baseline for future passes, #554). Each race has a
distinct, non-dominated package — for no single class archetype (melee str-build,
caster int/wis-build, agi-build) is one race's full package a superset of another's:

- **human** — the safe generalist: `agi +1`, `carry 60`, and *no* penalty anywhere. Its
  upside is genuine (universal agility edge + mid-pack carry) but the least extreme, so
  it is never the strictly-weakest pick yet never a superset of a specialist either.
- **elf** — the caster: `int +2`, `agi +2`, `mana +10`, paid for with `str -2`,
  `healing -2`, `attack -1` and the lowest carry (40).
- **dwarf** — the tank: `armor +2`, top carry (100), `str +2`, `wis +1`, offset by `agi -1`.
- **orc** — burst melee dps: `str +3`, `attack +5`, carry 90, paid for with `healing -2`,
  `mana -5`, `int -2`.
- **troll** — attrition/sustain melee: `str +3`, `healing +2`, carry 80, but crude
  `attack -3` (a real melee drawback, unlike the melee-irrelevant `int -3`) plus `int -3`,
  so it outlasts rather than out-damages orc's burst.

## Areas

Every room now belongs to exactly one formal `data/areas/` entry (#529), each with
hand-drawn ASCII map art, an obtainable map item, and atlas connections — all
enforced by `--validate-data`. The "Formal entry + map + atlas" column is therefore
a validator rule, not a manual checkbox.

| Area (formal id) | Formal entry + map + atlas | Quest coverage | Difficulty band documented |
|---|---|---|---|
| Greystone Town (`town`) | ✅ #529 | ✅ #518 (starter chain) | ✅ #550 |
| Darkwood Wilds (`darkwood`) | ✅ #529 | ✅ (rat/wolf/spider quests) | ✅ #550 |
| Broken Ruins (`ruins`) | ✅ #529 | ✅ (bandit quests) | ✅ #550 |
| Sunless Catacombs (`catacombs`) | ✅ #529 | ✅ (crypt/explore quests) | ✅ #550 |
| Undercity Sewers (`sewers`) | ✅ #529 | ✅ (plague-rat) | ✅ #550 |
| Frozen Peaks (`frozen-peaks`) | ✅ #529 | ✅ (frostbound-cull) | ✅ #550 |
| The Emberdeep (`emberdeep`) | ✅ #529 | ✅ (ember-culler, pyraxis) | ✅ #550 |
| Cinder Reaches (`cinder-reaches`) | ✅ #529 | ✅ (ember-culler, pyraxis) | ✅ #550 |
| Shrouded Isle (`shrouded-isle`) | ✅ #529 | ✅ (drowned-watch, tidebreaker) | ✅ #550 |
